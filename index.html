            Hi! My name is Keun Hong. I am a cancer biologist.
        </b>
        <p>
            I am a bioinformatician who strives to learn how we can use and develop computational models and methods to understand and control complex biological systems and treat disease.
            I look at cancer as a systems-level disease and therefore believe that a global view of the multiple levels of dysfunction in cancer will best inform clinical management strategies.
            I am training to become adept at using machine learning methods to leverage my research.
