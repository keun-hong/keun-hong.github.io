## Bridging Computers with SSH through VPN

### Problem and solution

In my line of work, my primary tool is a Windows laptop that I use to connect to several Linux workstations, each stationed in various locations. One illustration is presented below.

One particular workstation is situated in a university setting. Unfortunately, this institution has restrictions that block SSH connectionsâ€”presumably for security reasons. While remote control tools like "AnyDesk" and "RustDesk" offered viable alternatives (since they operate using assigned addresses rather than IP addresses), my preference was to maintain a consistent SSH connection.

After extensive research and testing, I stumbled upon a solution. If both computers run on Linux OS (as opposed to Windows), "AnyDesk" can allocate a local IP through its VPN (Virtual Private Network) feature. Using this method, I managed to establish a bridge connection between the two Linux computers via VPN. This allowed for SSH access, just as I had hoped.

In conclusion, with the right tweaks and tools in place, I successfully created a seamless work environment. Now, I can access every workstation from a single laptop, as depicted in the initial image.
