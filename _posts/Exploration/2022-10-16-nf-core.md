[Ewels P.A. et al. (2020) The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines. Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0439-x)

In the field of bioinformatics, some of the most pressing challenges include <mark>standardization, reproducibility, and portability of analysis pipelines</mark>â€”whether they are run locally or in the cloud. To address these issues, a community of bioinformatics experts came together to form nf-core. <mark>This initiative aims to design, validate, integrate, and share analysis pipelines using Nextflow, with the goal of creating standardized and reproducible workflows.</mark> Launched in 2018, nf-core has quickly grown to become one of the largest and most active communities within the workflow manager ecosystem.

On the nf-core website, you'll find a wide range of pipelines that cover a broad spectrum of fields, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics. Notably, they also offer pipelines related to single-cell omics and spatial omics, areas that are driving significant advances in biomedical research.

I highly recommend nf-core not only to beginners looking to design pipelines with Nextflow and developers eager to contribute to the community, but also to those new to the field of bioinformatics. The nf-core resources are invaluable for quickly understanding the flow of analysis pipelines across various fields, and they provide clear explanations of the tools used at each step. This makes it an excellent resource for overcoming the learning curve in bioinformatics.

Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your expertise, nf-core is an essential resource that can help you stay at the forefront of bioinformatics research and development.
