## Integrative Canine Data Commons (ICDC)

For my research, I've been gathering canine pan-tumor genomic and transcriptomic data from public database (DB). In public DB like NCBI's gene bank (GEO and SRA), there are many data produced by each other lab and institute through other experimental or sequencing method that make difficulty to integrate. So, Database including integratable pan-tumor data is prioritized, and It was ICDC.
