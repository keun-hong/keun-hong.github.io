Raw LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) proteomics data are typically published in dedicated public databases. There are several databases available for this purpose, some of which include:

1. **PRIDE (PRoteomics IDEntifications database)**: PRIDE is part of the ProteomeXchange consortium, which provides a single point for submission of mass spectrometry proteomics data to public-domain repositories. PRIDE is maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

2. **MassIVE**: MassIVE is a community resource developed by the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry to promote the global, free exchange of mass spectrometry data. MassIVE datasets can be assigned ProteomeXchange accessions to satisfy publication requirements.

3. **PeptideAtlas**: PeptideAtlas is a multi-species compendium of peptides identified in a large set of LC-MS/MS experiments. Data processed through the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline can be submitted.

4. **jPOST (Japan ProteOme STandard Repository)**: jPOST is a part of the ProteomeXchange consortium and provides an environment for data deposition of raw proteomics data.

5. **PASSEL (PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library)**: This is designed to serve as a public repository for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) data, including LC-MS/MS data.

When you are submitting your raw data, do check the specific requirements of the database you choose, as they can vary. In general, it's important to submit as much metadata as possible along with your raw data to ensure its utility to other researchers.
