I am currently managing two NAS (Network Attached Storage) systems, one for the lab and one personal, as shown in the picture below. When I joined the current lab for my PhD degree, I persuaded my professor to establish a Lab cloud. Today I'd like to discuss the reasons behind my proposal and why I use NAS for data management.

### Reasons for Persuasion and Advantages of NAS Implementation

1. **Protection Against Sudden Hard Drive Failure:**
   In the past, my 4TB hard drive suddenly failed, requiring a $500 recovery cost. Implementing RAID protects data from unexpected hard drive failures.

2. **Prevention of Data Loss Due to Device Theft:**
   A lab member lost their personal laptop, resulting in the loss of research data. Using NAS prevents data loss from portable device theft.

3. **Centralized Data Management:**
   A large amount of lab-generated data (NGS and proteomics-related) was scattered across multiple external hard drives without any organization. Centralizing data management through NAS ensures better data organization.

4. **Unified Data Management with Automatic Synchronization/Backup:**
   Research-related data and files were managed separately on different computers with manual backups. NAS enables data management under a single system/rule through automatic synchronization and backup.

5. **Real-Time Network-Based Data Management:**
   Data generated by experimental/analytical equipment at different locations was inconveniently transferred and managed via USB. NAS allows for real-time organization and management of files in personal folders via the network, simultaneously with the analysis.

6. **Cost-Effective Handling of Large Data:**
   Web-based solutions like Google Drive are secure but expensive and slow. NAS, although relatively less secure, is better suited for handling large amounts of data.

### Choosing Synology for Lab and Personal Cloud Setup

When selecting the Network-Attached Storage (NAS) equipment necessary for setting up a lab cloud, hardware across manufacturers was similar, but significant price differences arose due to software differences. Synology offered optimized OS and applications for NAS, making it the preferred choice.

### Important Considerations During Initial Setup

- **Network and domain configuration**
- **Security settings:** Issuing and registering SSL certificates for HTTPS access.
- **RAID configuration:** To prevent data loss due to hard drive failure (set to RAID 5 to ensure safety even if one drive fails, at the cost of reduced usable capacity).
- **Internal data backup**
- **External access configuration**
- **Creating user accounts for lab members**
- **Assigning different access permissions to each account**
- **Structuring folders according to purpose**

### Learning from a Near Disaster

While the equipment was in use, a sudden fire in the lab nearly resulted in the total loss of the NAS. This incident highlighted the vulnerability of relying on a single NAS and the necessity of data backup across devices located in different locations for complete security. If the budget allows, additional equipment will be set up.

### Complementary Use of NAS and Google Drive

Despite the many advantages of NAS, its stability has some weak points. Therefore, I use both Google Drive (2TB) and NAS simultaneously for different purposes.

### Conclusion

My initial motivation was to enhance the convenience for lab members and prevent data loss, contributing to the labâ€™s overall progress. Although the first setup consumed significant time, it was a meaningful experience as I learned a lot during the process and broadened my perspective on future data management.
