A variety of strategic tools for chromatin state segmentation have been developed over time. Among them, ChromHMM remains the most widely used and recognized. However, many other tools have been introduced to address its limitations, often offering superior performance under specific conditions.
Below is a comparative overview of these tools, highlighting their key features and reference citations.
