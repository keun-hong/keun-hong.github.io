**Chromatin states** in the field of epigenomics refer to <u>the organization and modification of chromatin</u>, which is a complex of DNA and proteins found in cells. These states play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and can influence various cellular processes. Understanding chromatin states is essential in epigenomics, as they provide <u>insights into how genetic information is regulated and expressed in different cellular contexts.</u>
