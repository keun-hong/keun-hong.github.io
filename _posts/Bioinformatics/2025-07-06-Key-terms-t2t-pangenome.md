This post summarizes essential terms and techniques used in Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome assembly and pangenome research, with concise definitions and reference illustrations

### What are the T2T assembly and Pangenome?

**T2T (Telomere-to-Telomere) assembly** refers to a complete, gapless genome assembly from one telomere to the other, including previously unresolved regions like centromeres and rDNA.

**Pangenome** is a comprehensive reference model that captures the full range of genomic diversity across individuals, populations, or species‚Äîgoing beyond a single linear reference.
